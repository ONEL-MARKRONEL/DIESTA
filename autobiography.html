        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Mark Ronel Dematera Diesta born on July 24, 2004 in Sorsogon Provincial Hospital. He is the third child of Nidy Dematera Diesta and Rolando Dematera Diesta. In a small town of Bacon, known for the oldest municipality of Sorsogon, where his family lives peacefully in the Barangay of Caricaran. Mark Ronel grew with his family that they didn't even say that they loved each other, they didn't vocalize the love that they had, instead they gave only the care and showed them in actions and not totally in words.
There are four children of Nidy and Rolando, two male and two female. The first daughter is Ronelyn Dematera Diesta. She is the older daughter of Nidy and Rolando, She worked in Japan as a factory sewer so that she can helped her parents to continue the study of her siblings, specially, Mark Ronel because He's studying in a private school that can be very helpful to pursued his dream to be a future law enforcer. The second is Jhon Roland Dematera Diesta, He is the older son and older brother of Mark Ronel, He is a water refilling delivery driver, He doesn't continued his study because of financial issues that time and also the struggles he face when he is studying in the time of pandemic. He is the one who helped his family by providing some expenses in household and school expenses. The youngest child of the family is Kris Nicole Dematera Diesta. She is a Grade 8 student and continued studying in Bogña Integrated School. She is a student that wants to be also a future law enforcer, specifically a police woman. She idolized her brother Mark Ronel because of his dedication and discipline as a student and also an Advance Cadet Officer of ROTC. 
Mark Ronel Dematera Diesta is a shy and quiet boy in his elementary and middle junior high school life. He graduated elementary, junior high school, and senior highschool also in Bogña Integrated School where Kris Nicole is studying in the present. Since he was a small kid, he wants to be in the army someday and wants to serve the country, so he studied college in Sorsogon College of Criminology Inc. and entered the world of being a cadet in Advance ROTC. His experience in the organization helps him to be a good student, child, brother, and citizen because he developed the discipline and learned how to manage his time. He learned so much knowledge and skills towards his dedication and perseverance to survive the cadetship. Mark Ronel is now a 2nd class officer of the said organization and continues to be a good leader and follower of his subordinates and upperclassmen. Mark Ronel wants to be in the army someday so that he joins the Advance ROTC, but it becomes very difficult for him to continue his dream because his parents don't support him to be a soldier someday. Rolando doesn't want it because he is experienced to be a CAFGU before. He said that it is very risky to be a soldier because your one foot is being graved to the ground even though you're still alive. Nidy, his mother added that being a soldier is very difficult for us because a soldier is assigned far away from your family and loved ones. Mark Ronel is confused about what he was going to choose, his parents want him to apply in PNP or BFP but then it doesn't want him to be that because it is not his dream off. He wants to serve the country by entering the grounds of AFP. He's trying to convince his parents what he was going to choose because it is the dream of him since he was a small kid.
